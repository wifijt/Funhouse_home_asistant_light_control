# Funhouse_home_asistant_light_control
This project uses the funhouse board from adafruit https://www.adafruit.com/product/4985 to control a light that has already been set up in home assistant. 
It uses the HA rest API to call the toggle service for the light specified in the code
If your light has brighness control you can use the funhouse slider to change the brightness. 

There are a bunch of other sensors on this board including PIR, temp, humidity, pressure etc I will write other guides that show how to send those to HA
